    "   \n",
    "   BUSINESS RULES & LOGIC APPLIED:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   1. MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE BRANCHING (The \"Yes\" Rule):\n",
    "      - If Col E is 'Yes' (or blank): Use ONLY Primary Columns B, C, D. Ignore E & F.\n",
    "      - If Col E is NOT 'Yes': Use ONLY Columns E & F. Ignore B, C, D entirely.\n",
    "      \n",
    "   2. DIRTY STRING PARSING (Mashed Concatenations):\n",
    "      - Col E and F often contain multiple Assessable Units mashed together without \n",
    "        spacing (e.g., \"123456 - Name - Seg123457 - Name - Seg\").\n",
    "      - Uses Regex to slice the string into individual blocks strictly at every 6-digit boundary.\n",
    "      \n",
    "   3. HYPHEN PROTECTION & FALLBACK:\n",
    "      - Extracts the 6-digit AU_ID.\n",
    "      - For the remaining text: If hyphens exist, splits Name and Segment based on the \n",
    "        LAST hyphen (protecting internal hyphens like \"Retail - Banking\").\n",
    "      - If no hyphens exist, treats the entire text as the AU Name with a blank Segment.\n",
    "      \n",
    "   4. DATA CLEANSING:\n",
    "      - Strips rogue leading/trailing double quotes (caused by CSV escaping).\n",
    "      - Converts double/multiple spaces into a single space.\n",
    "      - Strictly drops any ghost rows where the AU_ID or AU_Name is missing/blank.\n",
    "      \n",
    "   5. SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH (Deduplication & Standardization):\n",
    "      - Uses UNION and DISTINCT to remove duplicate AU mappings per Cost Center.\n",
    "      - Resolves naming conflicts across different Cost Centers (e.g., \"Insurance\" vs \n",
    "        \"General Insurance\" for the same ID) by using a Window Function to force a \n",
    "        single, standardized AU Name and Segment per AU_ID alphabetically.\n",
